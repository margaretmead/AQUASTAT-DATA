# Food and Agriculture Association of the United Nations's Global Information System on Water and Agriculture (AQUASTAT)
## About
This repository was created for Dr. Gotzler's English 105 class during the Spring 2024 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It contains the publicly available AQUASTAT dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 

It also contains a possible use case for the AQUASTAT data that subdivides the data into a subset of data containing countries in which less than 50% of the rural population has access to safe drinking water and whose GDP per capita is less than America's, based on data collected in the year 2020. This process was completed using Google Colab and is contained in a Colab Notebook. 

## Purpose


## What's Here?
### AQUASTAT contains data about various indicators of human development, environmental health, and water management by country since 1960. 

For over 200 countries, data for each of the following variables is listed:
* "Rural population with access to safe drinking-water (JMP)"
* "Total population with access to safe drinking-water (JMP)"
* "Urban population with access to safe drinking-water (JMP)"
* "Area salinized by irrigation"
* "Flood occurrence (WRI)"
* "Population affected by water related disease"
* "% of agricultural GVA produced by irrigated agriculture"
* "Agriculture, value added (% GDP)"
* "GDP Deflator (2015)"
* "GDP per capita"
* "Gender Inequality Index (GII) [equality = 0; inequality = 1)"
* "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)"
* "Human Development Index (HDI) [highest = 1]"
* "Industry, value added to GDP"
* "Number of people undernourished (3-year average)"
* "Prevalence of undernourishment (3-year average)"
* "Services, value added to GDP"
* "% of total country area cultivated"
* "Arable land area"
* "Cultivated area (arable land + permanent crops)"
* "Permanent crops area"
* "Total area of the country (excl. coastal water)"
* "Population density"
* "Rural population"
* "Urban population"
* "Total population"

## Where is this data from?
This  repository contains data from [AQUASTAT](https://data.apps.fao.org/aquastat/?lang=en), the publicly available dataset gathered by the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/). 
The data subset was compiled using Google Colab through Python.
